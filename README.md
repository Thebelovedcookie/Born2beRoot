In this project i needed to create a virtual machine.

The concept was very abstract for me, how could you have to type of os (operating system) on the same computer ?

There is a tool called, VirtualBox who's amazing. It allows us to creat a virtual machine (a virtual computer) with the os of your choice, in your own computer.

That was the first step of the projects. The second one, was to install and configure this virtual machine.

I learned a lot about virtualisation.
You'll find this project very usefull because there is several project who's asking for a vm.
